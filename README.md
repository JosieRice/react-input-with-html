## Modifier Arr

This is the customizable part of this component.

You need to pass an Array of ModifierObj(s) see type below

```
type ModifierObj = {
  regexMatch: RegExp
  htmlModification: string | Function // need better function definition, it has to return a html represented as string
}
```

The regexMatch is a regular expression to find the instances you want to modify

The htmlModification is the string that includes the html for what you're changing it to. This can be a string or a function that returns the string.
